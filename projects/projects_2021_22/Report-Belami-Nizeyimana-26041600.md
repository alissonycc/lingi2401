#  command-line-chess

For this project I knew I wanted to contribute to an open source project related to chess game but which one ? After having searched for a long time and compared a lot of  projects between them my I finally chose to contribute to **command-line-chess**. It is a python program to play chess against an AI in the terminal, it also allows us to play against a second player.

# Random move bug

Before I started my contribution, I had already spotted a bug. Indeed, the game offers to the player the possibility to make a random move if he can't decide. He just had to enter the "r" key on the console when it's his turn to play but it didn't work. Then, my first contribution was to fix the bug.

# Chess pieces

The first contribution I made was to give to the different pieces of the chess game a illustration
Before, the pieces were only represented by letters, 'p' for pawns, 'K' for knights, 'R' for rooks, 'B' for bishops, 'K' for kings and 'Q' for queens. So I decided to illustrate all these pieces with their respective images. 


"R" -> '♜', "N" -> '♞', "B" -> '♝', "K" -> '♚', "Q" -> '♛', "P" -> '♟'

# Chessboard

I decided to add a kind of chessboard to the game. From now on, players will have the possibility to play with black and white squares like a real Chess game. However, after thinking about it, some may find that there is too many images in the game because of this. In fact, before playing the game seems to be perfeclty 'balanced' but it's only after playing a few moves that you realize that the game is a bit messy with all its illustrations. So, I decided to keep the points : '.' instead of squares
